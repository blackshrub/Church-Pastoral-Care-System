The trajectory outlines the evolution of FaithTracker, a multi-tenant pastoral care application. The work began with an existing MVP and focused on several large-scale initiatives. A major effort was a mobile-first UI/UX redesign of the dashboard, migrating from a 7-tab layout to a cleaner, nested 3-tab structure to resolve overflow issues. Subsequently, a critical production caching issue was tackled; initially with manual data refetching, and later by refactoring the most critical pages (, ) to use  for robust state management.

A significant portion of the work involved a massive internationalization (i18n) effort, systematically removing hardcoded English text from over 13 pages and numerous components, replacing them with  keys, and populating both English and Indonesian translation files. This included debugging conflicting translation keys.

Numerous complex bugs were diagnosed and fixed, including incorrect timeline dates due to UTC vs. campus timezone mismatches in , and a subtle but critical bug where financial aid schedules disappeared due to a hardcoded 20-item limit in a backend MongoDB query.

The previous engineer's final action was to receive a comprehensive request to generate production-ready documentation for the entire project, including feature guides, API documentation, a  deployment guide for Debian, and an installation script.

<product_requirements>
The project, FaithTracker, is a multi-tenant pastoral care management system for the GKBJ church. It enables the pastoral care department to monitor and manage interactions with church members across multiple campuses.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Data is segregated by campus. A Full Administrator role can switch between campus views.
*   **CRUD Operations:** Full create, read, update, and delete capabilities for church members and various care events (e.g., Birthdays, Grief Support, Financial Aid).
*   **Task-Oriented Dashboard:** A central hub for users to view assigned tasks, categorized as Today, Overdue, and Upcoming.

**Work Completed:**
A major mobile-first UI/UX redesign was executed, which included:
1.  **Dashboard Refactor:** Migrated a 7-tab layout to a nested 3-tab structure to improve mobile usability.
2.  **State Management Overhaul:** To fix production data consistency issues, the  and  pages were refactored from manual / to use  for automated caching and UI updates.
3.  **Full Internationalization (i18n):** The entire application was refactored to support English and Indonesian, removing hardcoded text from all pages and components.
4.  **Extensive Bug Fixing:** Resolved critical backend logic bugs related to timezones, financial aid scheduling, and database query limits.

The final user request is to produce comprehensive, production-ready documentation for the project, including an installation script and a detailed deployment guide for a Debian server.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query (for  & ),  (for other pages)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Internationalization:**  for English (en) and Indonesian (id)
- **Scheduling:**  for backend jobs
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard monorepo structure with a Python backend and a React frontend.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the monolithic FastAPI server that contains all API endpoints, Pydantic models, and business logic for the entire application.
    - **Summary of Changes:** It was heavily modified to fix numerous critical bugs. Key fixes include: correcting timezone handling to use campus-specific timezones instead of UTC for event creation; fixing financial aid schedule logic for monthly/annual recurrences; and removing a hardcoded 20-item limit on a database query that caused schedules to disappear. A new endpoint () was also added.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main user-facing page and the most complex component in the application.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file underwent a complete architectural overhaul. Data fetching was migrated from manual  and  calls to  () to solve caching and data consistency issues. All mutation logic was updated to use  instead of manual refetching. The UI was also refactored from a 7-tab layout to a nested 3-tab structure.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The second most critical page, providing a detailed view of a church member.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Similar to the Dashboard, its data fetching logic was refactored to use . The Delete Entire Schedule functionality was changed to Clear Ignored History, now calling a new, dedicated backend endpoint.

- ** & **
    - **Importance:** These files are central to the application's bilingual support.
    - **Summary of Changes:** These files were massively expanded to remove hundreds of hardcoded English strings from across 13+ pages and various components. They were also debugged to resolve key conflicts where a single key was used for both a navigation string and a namespace object, which was fixed by renaming the object keys (e.g.,  -> ).

- ****
    - **Importance:** The root component of the React application.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file was modified to wrap the entire application in the  from , enabling the new state management and caching strategy.

<pending_tasks>
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Create complete, production-ready documentation as per the user's detailed request. This includes:
  - Project Overview and Feature Documentation (, )
  - Complete API Documentation ()
  - Codebase Structure Guide ()
  - Detailed Deployment Guide for a fresh Debian server ()
  - A comprehensive installation script to automate setup.
- **Incomplete React Query Migration:** Only  and  have been migrated to TanStack React Query. The remaining ~11 pages still use the older manual / pattern.

<current_work>
The AI engineer had just concluded an intense and successful multi-stage debugging and feature enhancement phase. This involved:

1.  **React Query Migration:** Migrated the two most complex pages ( and ) to use TanStack React Query to solve persistent data consistency issues in production.
2.  **Bug Fixing Marathon:**
    *   **Timezone Bug:** Fixed a bug where timeline events were recorded with the wrong date by ensuring backend endpoints use the correct campus timezone instead of UTC.
    *   **Financial Aid Logic:** Diagnosed and fixed a critical bug where financial aid schedules would disappear. The root cause was a hidden 20-item limit in a backend database query, which was removed.
    *   **UI/UX Fixes:** Corrected the Delete Entire Schedule feature to Clear Ignored History with a new backend endpoint, fixed a non-functional Complete button for upcoming birthdays, and removed a stray 0 from the UI.

The work concluded with the user confirming that all major bugs were resolved. The very last interaction was a new, comprehensive request from the user to create production-ready documentation for the entire project, including an installation script and a detailed deployment guide for a Debian server. The AI engineer has acknowledged this request but has not yet started implementation.
